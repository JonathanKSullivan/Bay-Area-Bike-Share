# Bay-Area-Bike-Share
I worked with real data provided by Bay Area Bike Share to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!
## Purpose:
For this project, I step right into a data analystâ€™s shoes by investigating a raw dataset, and sharing my findings using a Jupyter Notebook. This Project shows my ability to identify the key steps of the data analysis process, making an informed decision.

## How to use:
The project has 22 files the main files are:
* Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.html: Final Report
* Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.
* the rest of the files are the projects dataset.

### To view results 
Open up a browser window or tab. Click file then open. Navigate to the folder containing the project files and double click Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.html .
### To interact with ipynb file
